There are several different features in our smart mirror to help the day to day user with their routine. Everyone will be explained on both why it is there and also why it is in the location that it was put.

- First the mirror base screen. This screen is constantly running and gives the reflection without any icons on it. This is because If the user does not want any of the advanced features and just wants to use the mirror then they will not have to mess with complicated procedures.
- Next Is the time and date. These appears on the top left and right sides of the mirror respectively. It is in this position to not be obtrusive and be in a commonly looked place for this sort of features.
- Third is the personal tab in the top left. This button has an easily understood icon and text under to help the user understand what is used for. In this tab there is a calendar button that appears and when that is pressed it shows a basic calendar for the next week.
- In the top right there is the weather button that has an icon that obviously denotates what is in it. this feature when used will give the temperature and weather so that the user can see what to dress as.
- In the middle left there is the media button this icon when presses reveal three other features each to take a screenshot, use YouTube, and play Spotify using the mirror. All of these are media related features put under this button, so the user intuitively knows what is where.
- Then under that is the house button. this feature allows the user to change the temperature of the house depending on how they feel. and it also allows them to lock or unlock the front door something many Smart-House allow users to do remotely.
- Thin in the bottom right above the lightbulb is a twitter icon that when presses allow the user to see their twitter. This is also an intuitive feature that is easily identified by the user due to the widely known icon and at the same time is not intrusive.
- Under the twitter button is a lightbulb icon that when presses lights two light bars on the left and right of the mirror so that is the user needs more light.
-Finally, the last feature on the bottom left is a icon that looks like a back arrow that when presses will let the user go back to the main screen incase they want the mirror only.
